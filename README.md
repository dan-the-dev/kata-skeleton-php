# KATA SKELETON DAN THE DEV - PHP VERSION

## How to use the template

Create your own repository starting from the template here on GitHub - give a name meaningful for the Kata exercise.
The only requirement on your computer are: 
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

Then, clone it and install dependencies running the command `make install` from your terminal, in the root folder of the project.
After dependencies are installed, you can run tests via `make test`.

From now on, you can start with the Kata. 
I suggest you refactor names at first: for example, for `FizzBuzz` kata, I renamed the classes to `FizzBuzz` and `FizzBuzzTest`.
